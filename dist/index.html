A playlist is displayed with a preview as well as lyrics and a link to the spotify page for the song. ach song is displayed with a media player that gives a 30 second preview. When a song is clicked the lyrics will be displayed directly below the song, if lyrics cannot be found through the API a message will be displayed instead of lyrics. The spotify logo after each song will open a new tab to the song's spotify page giving the user the option to save it to their spotify profile. After each playlist is generated, a button below the dropdown menu will save the three most recent playlists so the user can load a recent playlist.</p>
